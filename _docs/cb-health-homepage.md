Why I Built This
I'm Ben, and I built CB Health Tracker for my father.

Like millions of families, I found myself in that painful place - wanting to protect my father while honoring his independence. The worry never went away. It sat with me in meetings, at dinner, late at night when the phone didn't ring but could have.

Did he take his medication? Is he eating enough? What if something happens and no one knows?

So I built this. Not as another piece of technology, but as the answer I was searching for. A way to care without hovering. A way to know - not just hope - that he was safe.

This isn't a corporate product. It's personal. It always has been.

I built it for my father. Now I'm sharing it with every family feeling what I felt: love, worry, and the constant wish to do right by the people who once cared for us.
