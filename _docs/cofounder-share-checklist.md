# Co-Founder Handoff: What to Share & Do

**For:** Marketing/Sales Co-Founder (GTM Lead)
**From:** Product/Engineering
**Action Required:** Review docs + start Week 1-2 tasks

---

## Documents to Share (Priority Order)

### 1. Must Read Immediately
**Share these 3 files:**
- `_docs/cofounder-handoff.md` - Her complete playbook (everything she needs)
- `_docs/why-cb.md` - The emotional core and founder story
- `_docs/user-flows.md` - How the product actually works

**Why:** These give her complete context on product, market, and what to build while you code.

### 2. Reference When Needed
**Share these 2 files:**
- `_docs/cb-2.md` - Marketing copy examples
- `_docs/prd.md` - Feature list and success metrics

**Why:** Copy inspiration and understanding what features exist when.

### 3. Optional (If She Wants Deep Dive)
- `_docs/product-roadmap.md` - Technical implementation details

**Why:** Most of this is your domain. She only needs it if coordinating launch timing.

## Division of Labor (Clear Boundaries)

### You Own (Product/Engineering)
- Building the entire product
- Technical decisions (stack, architecture, features)
- User testing with seniors (UX validation)
- Performance, security, infrastructure

### She Owns (Marketing/Sales)
- Landing page and waitlist growth
- All marketing content (emails, social, blog)
- Community engagement (Facebook groups, Reddit)
- Partnership outreach (AARP, agencies)
- Beta user recruitment
- Customer feedback collection (surveys, interviews)

### You Both Own (Shared)
- Product positioning (but she leads)
- Pricing strategy (but you have final say)
- Feature prioritization (you build, she validates market need)
- Beta launch coordination

---

## Communication Cadence

### Daily (Async)
- Slack/text for quick updates
- You: "Shipped medication reminders today"
- Her: "Got 10 new waitlist signups"

### Weekly Sync (30 min call)
**Agenda:**
- You: Product progress, what's ready for testing
- Her: Marketing metrics (waitlist, engagement), user feedback
- Together: Adjust priorities, plan next week

**Key questions:**
- What's blocking you?
- What do you need from me?
- Are we on track for beta launch?

### Monthly Strategy (60 min)
- Review: Waitlist growth, community traction
- Decide: Beta launch timing, pricing validation
- Plan: Next month's focus areas

---

## What She Needs From You (This Week)

### 1. Send Her the Docs
**Action:** Share the 3 "Must Read" files above
**How:** Email or shared Google Drive folder

### 2. Quick Kickoff Call (30 min)
**Agenda:**
- Walk through `cofounder-handoff.md` (10 min)
- Clarify division of labor (5 min)
- Answer her questions (10 min)
- Align on Week 1 goals (5 min)

### 3. Weekly Check-In Time
**Action:** Schedule recurring 30-min call (same day/time each week)
**Suggested:** Friday afternoon (reflect on week, plan next)

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Her Side
❌ No landing page by end of Week 1
❌ Waitlist <10 signups by end of Week 2
❌ Not engaging in caregiver communities
❌ Waiting for product to be "perfect" before marketing

**Your response:** "Start building demand now. Product will be ready when it's ready."

### Your Side
❌ Not sharing product progress weekly
❌ Building features she didn't validate with users
❌ Changing core features without telling her
❌ Delaying beta because "it's not perfect"

**Your response:** Ship MVP fast, iterate with real users.

---

✅ Joined 5+ caregiver communities
✅ 5-10 waitlist signups (early traction)
✅ Founder story drafted

### Your Wins
✅ Database schema deployed
✅ Authentication working
✅ Medication CRUD started
✅ Weekly sync scheduled

### Together
✅ Clear division of labor
✅ Communication rhythm established
✅ Aligned on beta launch vision (even if date TBD)

## Sample Message to Send Her

```
Hey [Co-Founder Name],

I've finished the product docs for CB Health Tracker. While I'm heads-down building this week, here's what you need:

**Read these 3 docs first (30 min total):**
1. cofounder-handoff.md - Your complete GTM playbook
2. why-cb.md - Our story and market opportunity
3. user-flows.md - How the product actually works

**Your Week 1 goals:**
- Get landing page live with email capture
- Start building our waitlist (goal: 100 signups before launch)
- Join caregiver communities and start engaging

I'm building the MVP this week. Let's sync Friday at [TIME] for 30 min to align on progress.

Docs are attached/in [shared folder link].

Let's build.

[Your name]
```

## Quick Reference: Key Files

| File | Purpose | Who Reads |

| `cb-2.md` | Marketing copy examples | She reads (reference) |
| `prd.md` | Features + metrics | She reads (reference) |

**Bottom line:** Send her `cofounder-handoff.md`, `why-cb.md`, and `user-flows.md`. Schedule 30-min kickoff. Let her run with Week 1 tasks while you build.

You focus on product. She focuses on demand. You both ship in parallel.
