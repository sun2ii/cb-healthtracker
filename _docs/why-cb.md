## CB Health Tracker – Structured Business Overview for Investors
Founder's Story: The Why Behind CB Health Tracker

CB Health Tracker  was born from a deeply personal place: a blend of love, worry, and responsibility. Like millions of caregivers, I faced the emotional dilemma of wanting to protect an aging parent while respecting their independence. I constantly found myself wondering:
    Did my father take his medication today?
    What if he falls and no one is there?
    Is he okay, even when I’m not around to check in?
    This quiet, constant worry doesn’t disappear. It follows you into meetings, late nights, and daily life. It’s an invisible burden that only those who’ve lived it truly understand.
    I created Nara as the answer to that ache. Not just as a piece of technology, but as a purpose-driven solution to help families stay connected, support loved ones from afar, and regain peace of mind without compromising dignity or independence.

## The Problem
Millions of families face the same challenge:
    Aging population: People are living longer, often with chronic conditions.
    Caregiver stress: Loved ones want to help but are stretched thin.
    Gap in solutions: Current tech is either too intrusive, overly medicalized, or difficult for older adults to adopt.

## The Solution: Nara
Nara is a connected care platform designed to bridge the gap between independence and safety. It empowers families to monitor, support, and communicate with aging loved ones — discreetly, respectfully, and intelligently.
Key features include:
    Non-intrusive monitoring: Tracks medication adherence, movement, and routines.
    Smart alerts: Notifies families of anomalies or potential risks.
    User-friendly interface: Built with simplicity for older users and clarity for families.
    Privacy-first design: Protects autonomy and avoids surveillance-like experiences.

## Market Opportunity
    Caregiving economy: $648 billion in unpaid caregiving in the U.S. alone.
    Aging-in-place tech market: Projected to reach $88 billion by 2031.
    TAM: 50+ million caregivers in the U.S., with growing global demand.

    Tiered pricing for individuals, families, and enterprise (e.g., home care agencies)
    Potential B2B partnerships with insurance, eldercare, and health providers

## Competitive Edge
    Emotional intelligence + technological intelligence
    Designed with caregivers, for caregivers
    Less invasive than wearables, more intuitive than complex health tech

## Conclusion: More Than a Product — A Movement
    For me, Nara isn’t just a startup. It’s personal. It began with my father, but it’s for every family navigating that quiet space between love and fear. Between doing enough and doing too much. Nara transforms worry into action, and love into smart, scalable support. We’re building not just a company, but a new standard for connected care.
