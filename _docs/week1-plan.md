# CB Health Tracker Week 1

## What I'm Building this Week

**CB Health Tracker** - Medication reminders + daily check-ins

### Features
- Medication reminders (push notifications)
- "I took it" confirmation button
- Daily "I'm OK Today" check-in
- Family connection (elder ↔ caregiver)
- Caregiver dashboard (real-time activity feed)
- Missed dose alerts
- Works offline
- PWA (no app store)

---

## How It Works

**Elder:** Add medication → Get reminder → Tap "I took it" → Check in daily
**Caregiver:** Send invite → Elder accepts → See activity feed → Get alerts if missed

---

## Positioning

**One-liner:** "Stop worrying if mom took her meds. Start knowing she's okay."
**Target:** Caregivers 40-60, worried about aging parents
**Differentiators:**
- Works offline (reliable)
- Elder-optimized (simple)
- Respectful, not surveillance

---

## Quick Win Tactics

**Email warm leads → Landing page → Social posts → Caregiver communities**
**Free channels:**
- LinkedIn (founder story)
- Reddit (r/CaregiverSupport)
- Facebook groups (engage daily, 15 min)
**Paid ($500/mo later):**
- Facebook ads (women 40-60, "caregiving")
- Google Search ("medication reminder app elderly")
