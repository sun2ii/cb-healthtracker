Why I Built Nara
Nara was born from love and from worry. Like millions of families, I found myself in that delicate and often painful place. I wanted to protect my father, who raised me, while also honoring his independence. How can I care for my father while juggling my own life while constantly wondering if he is okay? Did he remember to take his meds? What if something happens and no one knows?

That kind of worry doesn't go away. It sits with you in quiet moments, during meetings, and late at night. It's the kind of invisible weight that only those who've been there truly understand. So, I created Nara. Not just as another piece of technology, but as the answer I was searching for. A way to care for the people we love without taking away their dignity, a way to stay connected without hovering, and a way to know. Not just hope, but know that they're safe, well, and supported.

Nara is a way of turning that ache into action. It's the peace of mind we all longed for when we couldn't be there in person. It is the reassurance we wanted at 2 a.m. when the phone didn't ring but could have. It is the gentle bridge between independence and care, between freedom and safety.

For me, this isn't just a product. It's personal. It always has been. I created it for every family feeling the same things I did: love, fear, hope, and the constant quiet wish to do right by the people who once cared for us.
